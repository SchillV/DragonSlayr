Welcome to Dragonslayr!

To run the game, compile the Run_Game.py file

The boss key is '['

the entries in the options are, in order, for forward movement, backward movement, left turning and right turning of the player, followed by the downscale factor.

The game engine works with a downscaling factor in order to get a smoother fps count at the cost of how the game looks.
I recommend playing the game at a downscale factor of 12, and wouldn't recommend going over 40 with it.

The entries in the options are not labeled for a reason: they are also used for cheat codes!

to activate a cheat code, enter it in the first entry and hit apply

CHEAT CODES:

Kunami Code: invincibility cheat
Power Overwhelming: kill everything in one hit
Gamer Moment: instantly gain 1000 points

the cheat codes can be used both before and during the game loop

GamePlay tips:
the player will get trapped with the monsters until all of them have been killed
after that, the player can advance to the next room
when all of the rooms in a stage have been cleared, then the player can level up his atributes based on how many rooms were cleared
to advance to the next room, always go to the opening on the right
